This project aims to reveal the dark side of Internet based on the given article.
It is noticeable that today's network environment is filled with negative information, which might be harmful to our psychological health, especially for kids who don’t have enough ability to discern these contents.In this work I tried to create an uncomfortable experience which resembles some of the issues online.

The basic idea of this work is about manipulation of cartoon images that will insert undesirable message related to political agenda, violent and artificial intelligence. 
When players enter the editing mode, they are able to drag the images and change size, rotate them. While there will be voice repeatly saying the exactly same sentence which is pretty annoying. I intently make them feel like this way. So it is kind of like a mind-brushing.

I also hope to use this design to represent what we often experience in today’s network, there are many uncomfortable information like advertisements or negative pictures keep popping in when we are surfing the internet. And it is very hard to get rid of them.

The only way for players to stop the voice is to input the correct answer, which is a little challenging and trying to force the players to accept them

I only use three patterns for this work because they tend to be typical. The first one is about political propaganda, or it can also be interpreted as blindly following a leader. I think it is getting more and more obvious that the internet has been used a tool serving for political purpose. And for the children, although they might not be able to understand it, the message come across their minds can still influence them unconsciously and deeply. 

And another issue is about worshiping AI as god. This idea is actually getting common as the development of Ai is so fast and people immerge themselves in the internet more and more often. Our thoughts are also getting more and more robotic. And our souls are feeling more lost. While AI starts to defeat human beings in many math-based fields, some human beings feel the distance between AI and human beings are getting further so that them desperately feel that AI is as powerful as god. While we might have to admit that AI does better than human beings in some fields. The idea of worshiping AI is quite controversy.

There is also one pattern associated with violence. It is not rare to find bloody content related to kid’s channels, games online,videos. There are some scientific researches suggesting that kids who grow up playing more violent games tend to more aggressive and impatient. They might also face more problems with interpersonal skills. 
 
As it says in the cover image in this work, the cartoons can be an important part of childhood memories. And childhood memories tend to be very important that they might influence one’s whole life. Thus, building a healthy online environment is essential and benefit for the future of human beings.
