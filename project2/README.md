This project aims to reveal the dark side of Internet based on the given article.
It is noticeable that today's network environment is filled with negative information, which might be harmful to our psychological health, especially for kids who don’t have enough ability to discern these contents.In this work I tried to create an uncomfortable experience which resembles some of the issues online.

The basic idea of this work is about manipulation of cartoon images that will insert undesirable message related to political agenda, violent and artificial intelligence. 
When players enter the editing mode, they are able to drag the images and change size, rotate them. While there will be voice repeatly saying the exactly same sentence which is pretty annoying. I intently make them feel like this way. So it is kind of like a mind-brushing.

I also hope to use this design to represent what we often experience in today’s network, there are many uncomfortable information like advertisements or negative pictures keep popping in when we are surfing the internet. And it is very hard to get rid of them.

The only way for players to stop the voice is to input the correct answer, which is a little challenging and trying to force the players to accept them

I only use three patterns for this work because they tend to be typical. The first one is about trump is the lion king. It is about political propaganda, or it can also be interpreted as blindly following a leader. I think it is getting more and more obvious that the internet has been used a tool serving for political purpose. And for the children, although they might not be able to understand it, the message come across their minds can still influence them.

And another issue is about worshiping AI as god. This idea is actually getting common as the development of Ai is getting fast and people immerge themselves in the internet more and more often. Our thoughts tend to be more robotic. While AI starts to defeat human beings in many math-based fields,

There is also one pattern promoting violence. It is not rare to find bloody content related to kid’s channel online.
