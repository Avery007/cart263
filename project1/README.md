                                                      Statement of Project 1


The purpose of this project is to create an art-game which reflects the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus and some interesting thoughts regarding this myth.
In this story, Sisyphus was punished in underworld due to his betrayal of Zeus. He was ordered to roll a rock up to the top of a mountain, 
but every time when he moved near the top of the mountain, the rock rolled back down to the bottom thus he could never reach the destination.
Such cruel punishment seems to form an endless and desperate loop that Sisyphus could never escape from.

In order to reflect the core content of Sisyphus’s punishment, I use a gif in which a figure is trying to move a box up the stairs. But however hard he tries, he always stays at the same place because the stairs continue moving at a speed he cannot catch up with.

The myths might not just fairy tales for children, but they tend to contain truths of human life. I found the story of Sisyphus is also inspiring because we can experience the same feeling of Sisyphus’ punishment in our life while we are forced to do tasks which never end, or while we are so eager for something like happiness, but we always fail to reach it despite how close it seems. Thus it leaves a question for us to ponder: how should we deal with such situation wisely?

It is easy to think of suicide when people face a problem that they feel too desperate to go through. Suicide seems to be the easiest way to quit a tough game, doesn’t it? However, some spiritual texts like those in Buddhism suggest that suicide is not the way to escape from karma, but instead, people will repeat the same cycle of issues during their reincarnations. I found such perspective of suicide is interesting and I hope to reflect it in my game. I created a button though which player can choice to suicide, however, only to find that the game will restart and nothing really changes.

So does it mean there is no solution to Sisyphus’punishment, just like there is no way human beings can escape from their unfortune fate? 

Is it possible for us to observe the myth of Sisyphus in another way as we consider the concept of ‘Maya’ in Hinduism. The punishment might be just an illusion. It only works when one admits it. It is inevitable only when one believes it unavoidable. It is unbeatable only when one forgets his own power—the power of his mind, that he is actually trapped in his own mind. This doesn’t mean he can do whatever he wants without the punishment, but instead, he needs to embrace the nature law of universe, instead of stuck in the fear of the punishment which might be a self-projection. Perhaps by freeing our minds, we can be free from the punishment or the helpless feeling. Therefore, in this project I added a randomly moving bulb, which will generate a tool and the image of prisoned mind, and by dragging the tool to the right place, the previous images are gone and new perception rises.
