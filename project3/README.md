This project is a simulation of life in the smart cities of the future.

With the fast development of artificial technology, we are heading to the age of Internet of Things. Many scientists have predicted that
human society will more and more rely on computer technology in the near future. The proprosation of smart city suggests that almost 
everything is going to be chipped. We will have smart home, smart shopping center, smart hospital, smart education，etc. We are building 
a huge network that is going to include both living things and inorganic stuff. Many futurists argue that humanity are reaching the 
technological singularity. This is a turning point that machines don’t just serve as tools for human beings.The further intergration of 
human and computers is right at the corner.The concept of brain-computer interface will even give birth to human-AI hybrids. While some 
people think those advanced technology will bring huge convenience into our life. There are also concerns about privacy and surveillance issues. 
Some experts are also worried that the upcoming AI system wont improve human society, but it will make human souls further get lost in the virtual 
world. While some think the trend of advanced AI is inevitable,I strongly believe that the future is never fixed, but human collective have the 
power to shape what they want, and if we want to have a better future, we need to understand both pros and cons of the things and make decisions 
carefully.

This project is trying to present some of those concerns regarding the smart future in the field of education, job, shopping, medical 
checkup, delivery system, surveillance, and smart home. There are 8 different images representing different aspects for players to explore,
but in order to get into those sections, the traveler must firstly go to the police office and get an id. The education section presents 
the idea of inserting chips into brain for improving IQ. The Home section is a voice control journey by using annyang. In the hospital part,
the design is to make it feel like there is a powerful scanning machine that will know everything about the person by detecting DNA. The 
job market will match suitable jobs based a random IQ given in the education center, and all the best jobs it offers are related to 
advanced AI Technology. The shopping center is an online process, people can input a message to give an order. Finally, there is a smart 
drone that can be moved by using arrow keys. The key point of this project is that there is a data center that tracks and displays what 
players have viewed, giving a feeling as if people are being watched. This is similar to the privacy issue that have already happened 
in our life. The section and situations presented in this project are not just a fictional concept, but many of them have already happened.

This project is mainly based on Jquery. I also include responsive voice, annyang. And I use json data to generate random elements that 
represent players' personal info.
